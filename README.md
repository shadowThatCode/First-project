# First-project
This is my first pygame project

The game that I decide to make with pygame was snake. I'm aware that the code is probably bad but I learn a lot from it and this project was to see if I'm able to make a game and
as you can see I was able to. There are a few thing I wanted to add to the game but I'm not because I finish this a while back and I want to see my progress from my first project
to wherever I am in the future.

# Controls
w - up
s - down
a - left
